## This is a level 2 heading

This is **regular** old *text*!

and a list of stuff

- thing one
- thing two
- and another thing


```{r}
plot(1:5, col="blue", type="o")
```

### Type ctrl+alt+i to shortcut add an "R Chunk":

Let's insert a code chunk with the shortcut `CTRL-ALT-i`:

```{r}
x <- c(1:10)
x
```

Here is my analysis of your new data. It looks ok... the mean of your data is `r mean(x)`.

## More on reading input files

We will use the read.table() function again,

No good,
```{r}
read.table("test1.txt")
```

doesn't work,
```{r}
x <- read.table("test1.txt")
```

Test1: This does it!
```{r}
read.table("test1.txt", header = TRUE, sep =",")

```

Alternatively, read.csv to do this without argument.

```{r}
read.csv("test1.txt")
```

Test2: Here's another example.
```{r}
read.table("test2.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "$")
```


Finally, Test3:
```{r}
read.table("test3.txt", row.names = 1)
```

**int** stands for "integer". **fctr** stands for "factor".

read.delim() is coded by read.table()
read.table is the parent of all of them.

(If you type in just read.delim you see the structure calls the read.table function and argues with it.)

## Our first function

This is an example function named `add` with input `x` and `y`:

```{r}
add <- function(x, y=1) {
  #Sum the input x and y
  x + y
}
```

Let's try using it!

```{r}
add(x=c(1,6,2), y=4)
```

```{r}
add(1,6)
```



## In class lab exercise:
Section 1A
```{r}
# (A. Can you improve this analysis code?
df <- data.frame(a=1:10, b=seq(200,400,length=10),c=11:20,d=NA)
df$a <- (df$a - min(df$a)) / (max(df$a) - min(df$a))
df$b <- (df$b - min(df$a)) / (max(df$b) - min(df$b))
df$c <- (df$c - min(df$c)) / (max(df$c) - min(df$c))
df$d <- (df$d - min(df$d)) / (max(df$a) - min(df$d))
```

Let's make this into the **rescale** function! (This will also make this more reusable in the future!)

Let's reduce it down-- use a vector named x.


```{r}
#x <-(x- min(x) / max(x) - min(x))
```

Note how -min(x) is duplicated twice?
```{r}
#xmin <- min(x)

#x <- (x - xmin)/max(x) - xmin
```


Or just use range!

```{r}
x<- c(10,4,22,6)
min(x)
max(x)
range (x)
```

```{r}
rng <- range(x)
x <- (x - rng[1])/(rng[2] - rng[1])

```

Rescale the data to lie between 0 and 10:
```{r}
rescale <- function(x) {
  rng <-range(x)
  (x-rng[1])/(rng[2]-rng[1])
}
```

Let's test it:

```{r}
rescale(c(1:10, 30, 100))
```

What if we break it?
```{r}
rescale(c(1:10, NA))
```

How do you troubleshoot? Start from the top:
```{r}
x<- c(1:10, NA)

rng <- range(x, na.rm= TRUE)

rng
```

There we go!

```{r}
rescale2 <- function(x) {
  rng <-range(x, na.rm= TRUE)
  (x-rng[1])/(rng[2]-rng[1])
}
```

Now we repeat what broke it...

```{r}
rescale2(c(1:10, NA))
```

Now our code is more robust!

```{r}
rescale2(c(2, 3, NA, 6))
```

Let's make this more complicated:

```{r}
rescale3 <- function(x, na.rm=TRUE, plot=FALSE) {
if(na.rm) {
rng <-range(x, na.rm=na.rm)
} else {
rng <-range(x)
}
print("Hello")
answer <- (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])

print("is it me you are looking for?")
if(plot) {
  print("Please don't sing again!")
plot(answer, typ="b", lwd=4)
}
print("I can see it in ...")
}
```

```{r}
rescale3(x, plot= TRUE)
```

## Working with bio3d package

To use the functions from any package installed, we use the `library()` to load it!

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```


















### This is a level 3 heading

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
