## Coronavirus

Here we analyze infection data for the 2019 novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) epidemic. The raw data is pulled from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) Coronavirus repository.

A CSV file is available here https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus-csv


```{r}
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/COVID-2019"
virus <- read.csv(url)

tail(virus)
```

## We can use R Tidyverse to calculate our statistics as well!

This has become increasingly popular in the last few years, it's like a different language that's pretty compatible with other languages such as Python.

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

How many infected per country?

```{r}
cases_by_country <- virus %>%
  group_by(Country.Region) %>%
  summarise(tot=sum(cases)) %>%
  arrange(desc(tot))

head(cases_by_country)
```
