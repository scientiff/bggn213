## Coronavirus

Here we analyze infection data for the 2019 novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) epidemic. The raw data is pulled from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) Coronavirus repository.

A CSV file is available here https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus-csv


```{r}
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/COVID-2019"
virus <- read.csv(url)

tail(virus)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
attributes(virus)
```


> Q1. How many total infected cases are there around the world?

```{r}
total <- sum(virus$cases)
total
```

>> There are 144,233 cases worldwide.

> Q2. How many deaths linked to infected cases have there been?

```{r}
table(virus$type)
```

```{r}
inds <- virus$type == "death"

head(virus[inds,])

deaths <- sum(virus[inds,]$cases)

deaths
```

>> There are 3,160 deaths linked to the infected cases.

> Q3. What is the overall death rate?


```{r}
death_rate<- round((deaths/total)*100, 2)

death_rate
```

>> The overall death rate is 2.19%.

> Q4. What is the death rate in Mainland China?

```{r}

#First, calculate the total number of cases in Mainland China.

chinese_cases <- virus$Country.Region == "Mainland China"
  
chinese_total <- sum(virus[chinese_cases,]$cases)

chinese_total

#Next, specify that we're looking for deaths in "Mainland China".

chinese_inds <- virus$type == "death" & virus$Country.Region == "Mainland China"

head(virus[chinese_inds,])

chinese_deaths <- sum(virus[chinese_inds,]$cases)

chinese_deaths

#Finally, calculate death rate by dividing deaths/total in "Mainland China".

chinese_death_rate <- round((chinese_deaths/chinese_total)*100, 2)

chinese_death_rate

```

>> The death rate in Mainland China is 2.26%

> Q5. What is the death rate in Italy, Iran, and the US?

Italy
```{r}

#First, calculate the total number of cases in Italy.

italian_cases <- virus$Country.Region == "Italy"
  
italian_total <- sum(virus[italian_cases,]$cases)

italian_total

#Next, specify that we're looking for deaths in "Italy".

italian_inds <- virus$type == "death" & virus$Country.Region == "Italy"

head(virus[italian_inds,])

italian_deaths <- sum(virus[italian_inds,]$cases)

italian_deaths

#Finally, calculate death rate by dividing deaths/total in "Italy".

italian_death_rate <- round((italian_deaths/italian_total)*100, 2)

italian_death_rate

```

>> The death rate in Italy is 2.88%.

Iran

```{r}

#First, calculate the total number of cases in Iran.

iranian_cases <- virus$Country.Region == "Iran"
  
iranian_total <- sum(virus[iranian_cases,]$cases)

iranian_total

#Next, specify that we're looking for deaths in "Iran".

iranian_inds <- virus$type == "death" & virus$Country.Region == "Iran"

head(virus[iranian_inds,])

iranian_deaths <- sum(virus[iranian_inds,]$cases)

iranian_deaths

#Finally, calculate death rate by dividing deaths/total in "Iran".

iranian_death_rate <- round((iranian_deaths/iranian_total)*100, 2)

iranian_death_rate

```

>> The death rate in Iran is 2.85%.

United States (US)

```{r}

#First, calculate the total number of cases in the "US".

american_cases <- virus$Country.Region == "US"
  
american_total <- sum(virus[american_cases,]$cases)

american_total

#Next, specify that we're looking for deaths in "US".

american_inds <- virus$type == "death" & virus$Country.Region == "US"

head(virus[american_inds,])

american_deaths <- sum(virus[american_inds,]$cases)

american_deaths

#Finally, calculate death rate by dividing deaths/total in "US".

american_death_rate <- round((american_deaths/american_total)*100, 2)

american_death_rate

```

>> The death rate in the US is 5.11%.
